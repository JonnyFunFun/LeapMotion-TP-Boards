LeapMotion-TP-Boards
====================

This is a mashup to interface the Leap Motion controller with TargetProcess 3's boards

Current functionality includes clicking and double-clicking cards via screen tap and key tap gestures (respectively).  When the detail window of a story/task/bug/whatever is open, swipe down to close the screen.

More gesture support is coming soon.

Dragging is not yet functional.
